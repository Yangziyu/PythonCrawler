Finished the ShanghaiRanking Part, and stored data in ../ShanghaiRanking.xls .
BTW, config_shanghairanking_v2.json 's format is pretty good now.

Here is the improvment idea of it:
    1. for the column of Nation, we got <img src="image/flag/USA.png">,
        since it's may not able to using re with xpath filters in json files,
        So, we are going to do some special re with this column.
    2. here we are done with ShanghaiRanking,
        next we are going to deal with the other ones.

first, use json file as the rule configraton file.
    1.add specific xpath for each cloumn item.
      表格每行的循环的话，就不能制定准确的xpath，所以具体是哪一行我们用循环来将行数插入到xpath
      string中。
    2.create one json file for one website.
    3.for the item in Item that we don't have, we dont list it here.

second, use something(list or maybe Item) to store each row of table,
        then storing to excel files.
       1. we create Item with all the item we need, if we dont have it here, for
          example: index_top, OK, we just put it blank. And we dump it to excel,
          the column just blank, its of cource OK for it


third, read from rules config files, genrate the spider_for_each_rules.
        fill up the Item.

明天：
按照三部曲写spider.
